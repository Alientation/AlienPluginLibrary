CustomGUIAPI -> creates a blueprint for a gui (should be renamed to CustomGUIBluePrintAPI)

CustomGUIManager -> stores CustomGUIBluePrints, maps id to CustomGUIBluePrint

CustomGUIBluePrint -> stores a general layout, attributes, and functionality, maps id to CustomGUI
CustomGUI -> created from the blueprint, essentially a functional version of the blue print

Button Annotation -> annotates where a button is located and the functionality it has
EventHandler Annotation -> annotates a method that handles an event passed from server
GUIMarkerAnnotation -> (prolly rename) annotates the blueprint holder
SlotIDAnnotation -> annotates the slot location in a blueprint

there should be a general annotation of the class that extends CustomGUIAPI that details
attributes of the blueprint (so like the blueprintID, title, size


For specific GUIs like furnaces and brewing stands, allow user to annotate that
in CustomGUIBluePrint -> detail the Inventory type

Add console logging messages
