Link command permissions with custom permission
add more options/settings to custom command (whether to show all available commands even if sender doesn't have permissions)
Log tools (probably separate)
More annotations
Reflection library to easily compare parameter and return types if it matches


Implement Command Creation on runtime
Implement parameter matching using parameter flag annotations


Possible Bugs
Get usage (and possible description) to work. it does not  display it when the onCommand method returns false
If command execute method doesn't return a boolean, it might crash or cause exception
argument annotations haven't been tested nor has the conditions either



CommandAlias should be an alternate unique id that also refers to the current command
instead of an alternate command name

perform checks for duplicate command ids

Dependency Injection for command executors and tab complete (essentially parameter flagging)

CatchUnknownCommandAnnotation catches any non valid child command that attempted to be executed
CatchInvalidArgumentAnnotation

CommandCompletionAnnotation just lists out hardcoded completion options

Able to register own conditions
