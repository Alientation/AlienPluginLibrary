# Alien Plugin Library (APL) [UNDER-DEVELOPMENT]

## Purpose

This is an extensive Spigot plugin development library created to offload many repetitive tasks involved with developing Spigot plugins and servers. 

It is a one-for-all library that will eventually cover most if not all necessary features for server and plugin development.

This library currently contains a working command framework that abstracts much of the code involved with command executors and tab complete.
