Link command permissions with custom permission
add more options/settings to custom command (whether to show all available commands even if sender doesn't have permissions)
Log tools (probably separate)
More annotations
Reflection library to easily compare parameter and return types if it matches


Implement Command Creation on runtime
Implement parameter matching using parameter flag annotations


Possible Bugs
Get usage (and possible description) to work. it does not  display it when the onCommand method returns false
If command execute method doesn't return a boolean, it might crash or cause exception
If there is no parent command defined but a child command is defined will not properly load in the parent command
argument annotations haven't been tested nor has the conditions either

MAJOR BUG
Ordering of annotated commands in CustomCommandAPI extended class might cause bugs when reading in a
method for a child command before the parent command is read in/loaded
